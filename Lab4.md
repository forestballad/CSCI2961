Make sure you write up in a blog post about what you changed, why it is important to maintain good documentation, and what you have learned from this lab. Also include a write-up of our debate last class, and specifically the reasons for open source software, reasons for proprietary software, reasons why a company and an individual might choose one or the other, which you would choose if you were doing a side project and which you would choose if you were starting a company and why.

I changed some bad expression in FAQ. It is important to maintain good documentation because good documentation have effect on good code. It could save everyone's time if question could be answered easily by the documentation. I've learnt that running spell checker could be a good trick doing these things...


Open software often have more flexibility(and cost less). A proprietary software is more fixed, but might have better support. A company might choose to use a proprietary software because it's a more reliable choice: if something went wrong, they could always call for help. Individual might look into open software, as they are more playable.

I would choose open software if doing a side project, and a proprietary software if start a company.
