Without license the software by default become 'all rights reserve', which would not be open source. When trying to give the rights to public, it is better to choose a license that someone does that profrssional writing work for you.

Vague part in license has the possibility to cause liability problems. Also when a software is composed of several parts, the part with the most strict licnese would overwrite other ones, that might not be the intension of the owner.

I don't entirely agree with that. There would be many things happening during the development progress of large-scaled software project. Open System Model won't guarantee the success.

Linux uses GPL v2 probably because that's the core spirit since the creation. As they want a free operating system.

LGPL is better, as it is opening itself and ask people to contribute. But also allow the usage of it.
