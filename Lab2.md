**2.Why it is important to choose a LICENSE**

Without license the software by default become 'all rights reserve', which would not be open source. When trying to give the rights to public, it is better to choose a license that someone does that profrssional writing work for you.

**3.Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have a explicit license**

Vague part in license has the possibility to cause liability problems. Also when a software is composed of several parts, the part with the most strict licnese would overwrite other ones, that might not be the intension of the owner.

**4.Why Gopher failed and HTTP survived?**

I don't entirely agree with that. There would be many things happening during the development progress of large-scaled software project. Open System Model won't guarantee the success.

**5.Justify the license**

Cocos2d-x didn't use standard license. From reading I think it's using the MIT, for it allows doing anything to it as long as it keep the same licnese. They want to keep it open to society.

**7.**

LGPL is better, as it is opening itself and ask people to contribute. But also allow the usage of it.

**9.Introduce myself**

I'm a senior about to graduate. I'm interested in game development. I could do C++, python and javascript. C# when developing game in Unity.
